# Mirror VR Player
VR video player which can be synced / mirrored to other clients. The idea behind the Mirror VR Player is to watch a video on multiple devices (including VR),  at the same time and in sync. The current implementation is a very raw proof of concept which shows how to display videos in VR and how to sync it with a common browser player.

The player itself is implemented with videojs and videojs-vr. The included webserver is based on kotlin
